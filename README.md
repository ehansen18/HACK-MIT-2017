# HACK-MIT-2017
Emily Hansen and Melanie Nesteruk project for HACK MIT 2017.
This code is from a tutorial https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-button-function-events/?completed=/pygame-button-function/
We planned on highly modifying it to customize it for our purpose. This was our first time using pygames so we used this as a guide, however the time crunch did not allow us to truly edit it to our purposes.
